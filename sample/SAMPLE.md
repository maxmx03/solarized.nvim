# Sample

In order to improve the quality of our screenshots, we created this folder
with standardized code snippets.

## Instructions

After you're done taking a screenshot, feel free to delete this `sample` folder.

## Why this is cool?

- It contains examples of string, number, and array
- It contains examples of single line and multi-line comments
- It contains examples of inheritance and functions
- It's simple, funny, and silly :)

## Is there a programming language missing?

Feel free to send a pull request. This will help new theme authors to create
awesome screenshots.
